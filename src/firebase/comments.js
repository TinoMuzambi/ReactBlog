						comment: `I can just imagine people walking around holding their laptops because they want to walk and text ayy.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ But same, I'd chose my laptop any day over my phone. I've survived many weeks this year only with just my laptop so it's doable, though I guess in this future we'd now be able to use WhatsApp without needing a phone so definitely the laptop.`,
