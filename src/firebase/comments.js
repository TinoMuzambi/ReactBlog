I've survived many weeks this year only with just my laptop so it's doable, though I guess in this future we'd now be able to use WhatsApp without needing a phone so definitely the laptop.`,

					comment: `I was thinking about this and I'm gonna use a beach example, so we were at Camps bay and that water is cold as hell, when I first got in the water it was like freezing cold but over time my body adjusted and even though the temperature of the water there didn't change my body adjusted such that I didn't feel like the water was that cold anymore, so applying that into this I think somehow someway the body will adjust in such a way that you don't really feel it because this will be very very slow right? And instead of being in the shower for ages you can try it with your hand in the basin for like an hour and see if you feel the difference.🤷‍♀️`,

					comment: `Wow 😹😹😹 I agree on the part were you will rather ignore someone who has sent you a voice note and only open it later.
				And the fact that when you move your phone it stops playing .
				Things I like about voice notes : I can express what I want to say properly and that does not allow the next person to create their own emotions towards a certain text message. I typed it with love you read it with anger so voice notes help , they allow me to scream with excitement or shout at a person cause they are ignoring my voice note 😹😹. Last reason why is because my English is not as great as other people not that I'm comparing 💆🏽‍♀️. I prefer speaking and also that my pronunciation is bad 🙆🏽‍♀️ but it's better than texting , then you get typing error 😭😭
				Anyways well done I love it 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯. It's funny and honest.`,

					comment: `I completely agree with you . I am not saying that i don't send voicenotes myself , i do and like mentioned above because i will be feeling lazy to type. i agree with you Tino 90% but if you do think about it voicenotes may be beneficial to those who are driving or doing something and my not have time to actually type something out . please i am not encouraging driving and texting (DON'T GET ME WRONG THERE ). Stop and think about this . when you recieve a text that is deep and has alot of emojis to give it that extra punch and trying to make the reader understand how you are feeling right . sending a voicenote really does all the work for you. the tone of your voice really does put across a message faster and easier .

				 BUT OTHERWISE I AGREE , I LOVE MUSIC AND IT IS A IRRATAING TO HAVE TO CONSTANTLY PAUSE TO LISTEN TO VOICENOTE!!`,

I even listen to them after and laugh ukuthi shame, this person has to listen to all this drama and nonsense I said there. And it's true, used correctly they're great because see I'm dramatic and it's kinda hard to be dramatic on text you know it doesn't have that thing.
		What I HAAAATE about them though is when I'm busy recording(on my PC) at that time I'm on five minutes and find that I was laughing even, and then it decides to cancel it. 😭😭 Yhoo, I get so mad because now I have to relaugh so nje it's a lot. And at that time I've even forgotten what I wanted to say. So I think it's safe to say I've got a hate love relationship with them. Wow I just typed an essay okay lemme stop. 😂`,
